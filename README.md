# Todo App

Welcome to the Todo App! This is a simple application built with React for managing your tasks.

## Introduction

This Todo application helps you keep track of your tasks by allowing you to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when they're done. It's a great way to stay organized and manage your daily activities.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks by entering a title and an optional description.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Toggle the completion status of tasks with a single click.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The front-end of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Styled-components:** Styling is done using styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS directly in your JavaScript files.
- **Context API:** The Todo data is managed using React Context API, which provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It simplifies state management and makes it easier to share data across components.
- **localStorage:** Todo data is stored locally in the browser using the localStorage API, ensuring that your tasks persist even after you close the browser.
